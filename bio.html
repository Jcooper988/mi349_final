      <h2 class="basic">My Story</h2>
      <p class="basic">I am born and raised in Chicago, Il.<br>
         I grew up going to many different school but <br>
         at a young age I was inspired to start my own business.
         I had many challenges but I decided to do cooking.<br>
         I liked to eat and cook steaks and I liked to <br>
         cook many different things. Eventually when I 
         went to college, I decided to pursue my passion <br>
         of opening up my own food business.
